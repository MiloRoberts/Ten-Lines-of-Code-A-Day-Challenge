    <h1>Ten-Lines-of-Code-A-Day-Challenge</h1>

    <h2>Rules</h2>

    <p>1. Participants of the challenge will, at the outset, agree upon a project to work on. The project goals need not be laid out in great detail; such things can develop organically as work progresses.
        2. Each participant, in turn, will be responsible for contributing at least 10 (but no more than 15) lines of code per day. Alterations to code already present count towards this limit.
        3. No more than three files and/or folders can be added per day. These do not factor into the 10 lines of code count.
        4. If, for some reason, a participant cannot contribute on his or her day, it is that individual's responsibility to inform the next person in line of such. That other individual will cover for him or her, and a make-up day will be decided upon.</p>
